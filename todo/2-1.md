Different Blockchains  [Smart contracts][3] and the [blockchain technology][4] are all the rage right now. More and more people are trying to get into this amazing space for one reason or another. If you are new to this technology and are looking for a quick primer on blockchain-based developing platforms then this guide is perfect for you. The platforms that we are going to be focussing on and comparing are:

* [Ethereum][5]
* [Cosmos][6]
* [Cardano][7]
* [EOS][8]
* [Hyperledger][9]

## Different Blockchains

## Blockchain Battle: Ethereum vs Cosmos vs Cardano vs EOS vs Hyperledger

 

So, why have we decided to focus on these 5? We feel that this group gives a healthy mixture of usability and functionality. Yes, we know that some of these projects are not exactly live, but we still feel that the potential of the projects is enough to warrant a place on our list. We are going to go through each and every platform and then compare them at the end.

## Ethereum

_**Token: ETH**_

Ethereum is, without a doubt, the big daddy of [smart contract platforms][12]. The main man behind [Ethereum][13] is Vitalik Buterin. Buterin was fascinated with Bitcoin, but he realized that the blockchain technology had far more use than being a mere facilitator of a payment protocol. He realized that one can use the blockchain technology to create decentralized applications. That was when he was inspired to create [Ethereum][13].

Ethereum, like Bitcoin, was a cryptocurrency, however, that's where the similarity ends. Because while Bitcoin is a "first-generation" blockchain, Ethereum broke the mold by becoming the first ever second-generation blockchain. Ethereum revolutionized the crypto-space by bringing in [smart contracts][3] on the blockchain.

[Smart contracts][14] were first conceptualized by Nick Szabo. The idea is simple, have a set of self-executing instructions between two parties which don't need to be supervised or enforced by a third-party. The idea seems pretty straightforward, right? However, smart contracts enabled Ethereum to create an environment wherein developers from around the world could create their own [decentralized][15] application aka Dapps.

## Dapps and Smart Contracts

Dapp creation is one of the most important features of Ethereum.  Along with being decentralized, there are certain other features that a Dapp must have:

* The source code of the Dapp should be open to all
* The application must have some sort of tokens to fuel itself
* The App must be able to generate its own tokens and have an inbuilt consensus mechanism

Sounds pretty awesome right? So, how exactly can you build them? You need to[ code smart contract][3]s using [solidity][16].

Developers use a programming language called Solidity which is a purposefully slimmed down, loosely-typed language with a syntax very similar to ECMAScript (Javascript).

Along with creating the smart contract, you must have an environment where you can execute it. However, there are some properties that this execution environment must have. These properties are:

* Deterministic.
* Terminable.
* Isolated.

_属性 #1: Deterministic_

A program is deterministic if it gives the same output to a given input every single time. Eg. If 3+1 = 4 then 3+1 will ALWAYS be 4 (assuming the same base). So when a program gives the same output to the same set of inputs in different computers, the program is called deterministic. The environment must make sure that execution of the smart contract is always deterministic.

_属性 #2: Terminable_

In mathematical logic, we have an error called "halting problem". Basically, it states that there is an inability to know whether or not a given program can execute its function within a time limit. In 1936, Alan Turing deduced, using Cantor's Diagonal Problem, that there is no way to know whether a given program can finish in a time limit or not.

This is obviously a problem with smart contracts because, contracts by definition, must be capable of termination in a given time limit. So the environment must be able to halt the operation of the smart contract.

_属性 #3: Isolated_

In a blockchain, anyone and everyone can upload a smart contract. However, because of this the contracts may, knowingly and unknowingly contain virus and bugs.

If the contract is not isolated, this may hamper the whole system. Hence, it is critical for a contract to be kept isolated in a sandbox to save the entire environment from any negative effects.

Ethereum executes its smart contracts using a virtual machine called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

The next core Ethereum concept that one must understand is [gas][5].

## What is Ethereum Gas?

Remember the "Terminable" 属性 of smart contract environments? Well, Ethereum smart contract achieves this 属性 by utilizing gas. Each and every line that is coded in the smart contract requires a certain amount of gas to execute. So, when a developer submits a smart contract for execution, they also specify the maximum gas limit.

Think of the gas limit as the fuel you fill up in your car before going for a drive, the moment the fuel runs out, the car stops working. Each and every line in the smart contract requires a certain amount of gas to execute. Once the gas runs out, the smart contract stops executing.

## Ethereum and ICOs

We have covered this topic at length before so we will just go over this very briefly. One of the most alluring features of Ethereum is initial coin offering or [ICO][17]s. Developers around the world can use Ethereum's virtual machine to power their smart contracts and use the platform to raise lots of money in a crowded sale with relative ease. Because of this very feature, Ethereum's adoption has gone through the roof.

### Ethereum Mining

Ethereum as of right now is using the [Proof-of-Work][18] mining, i.e. the same mining process used by [Bitcoin][19]. Basically, miners compete to find the next block in the chain by using their processing power to solve complex cryptographic puzzles.

Ethereum is eventually going to move on to Proof-of-Stake by utilizing the [Casper protocol][20]. POS is far more environmentally friendly than POW and is a lot more scalable.

### Main Problems

There is no doubt of the impact that [Ethereum][13] has had on the crypto-space, however, there are some major problems surrounding its performance. As of right now, Ethereum fails when it comes to scalability. They can only manage 25 transactions per second, which is not ideal for Dapps who want mainstream adoption. On top of that, Ethereum can be expensive for developers. The gas prices for the execution of Dapps can go through the roof.

Along with these, there is one more problem that affects Ethereum and other [cryptocurrencies][21]. This problem is interoperability. As of right now, if Alice owns Bitcoin and Bob owns Ethereum, then there is no easy and direct way for the two to interact with each other. This is a really big issue because in the future, there may be thousands of blockchains running in parallel and there should be a way for them to interact seamlessly with each other.

One project that is aiming to solve this interoperability problem is Cosmos.
