The whole world is going through a blockchain revolution. But people familiar with blockchain know that it's not going that well. One of the greatest problems with blockchain today is its poor scalability, which is stopping blockchain to be accepted in the mainstream. It still takes several minutes to get a transaction confirmed which sometimes makes people lose their shit.

Currently, 2 types of solutions are being worked upon to tackle this problem: side chains and state channels. You can go to the below article if you are interested in side chains and how it is different from state channels.

But, here we are going to explore 10 state channels. So let's get started!

### 1\. [Lightning Network][5]

**Status**: _Live_

**Type: **_payment channel(can scale payments only)_

Lightning is a decentralized network using smart contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant payments across a network of participants.

It is dependent upon the underlying technology of the blockchain. By using real Bitcoin/blockchain transactions and using its native smart-contract scripting language, it is possible to create a secure network of participants which are able to transact at high volume and high speed.

#### Features

* **Instant Payments: **Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments.
* **Scalability: **Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians.
* **Low Cost: **By transacting and settling off-blockchain, the Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees, which allows for emerging use cases such as instant micropayments.
* **Cross Blockchains: **Cross-chain atomic swaps can occur off-chain instantly with heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules. So, as long as the chains can support the same cryptographic hash function, it is possible to make transactions across blockchains without trust in 3rd party custodians.

### 6\. [Counterfactual][24]

**Status: **_Not Live_

**Type: **_generalised state channels(can scale payments and smart contracts)_

Counterfactual is building generalized state channels on Ethereum. The idea behind state channels is that we can make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchain's characteristic trustworthiness.

Their focus is on long-term possibilities of the Ethereum project/blockchain technology, researching and developing novel techniques for state channels that increase privacy; have support for parallel operations; provide verified, audited, and expertly optimised components; and that establish clear standards for how all of these generalised state channels will fit together into a global, multi-blockchain network where any user can easily connect to any other.

Presently, they are focused on internally progressing the framework to an abstraction that makes developing "channelized" applications easy and intuitive.

It is going to buy fresh vegetables while you drive. Allow the devices to care about you. Allow them to transfer money in autonomous and secure way.

An idea behind Machinomy project is to allow any device to pay another device a minuscule amount of money over the internet. In short: to provide a viable means of exchange for machine economy. Current implementation is a Node.js package. It represents a somewhat constrained vision: allows a device to instantly pay a fraction of Ether over HTTP, no trust established. Actually, the device is a networked computer able to run geth and Node.js. A server or your laptop qualify, as well as Raspberry Pi board.

#### Features

* **_Nearly zero fees_**
* **_Immediate payments_**
* **_Simple API_**
* **_Any device_**

### Updated List

### 11\. [Connext Network][42]

Their aim is to make_ _dApp user experience easy for everyone, so that the user doesn't even realize that they are using blockchain. According to [their article][43]:

> Plasma(a sidechain) is awesome, we recognize that it is a mechanism most effective for handling n-party ecosystems (n>2).

So, they come up with state channels to solve the above issue. But as we know that state channels are only useful(economically) if the transacting parties transact multiple time within single state channel creation. In order to solve this they have come up with concept of [state channel hubs][44].

They aim to make the concept of state channel approachable to all and in a much easier way, so that you don't have to hire a state channel expert to implement it. According to [their article][43]:

> In the same way that Loom has made Plasma approachable, we hope to make state channels easy to implement for every project. We aim to do this by collaborating closely with both existing applications and other approaches to scaling, to create one seamless developer experience.
