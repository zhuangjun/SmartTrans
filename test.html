<div class="body__content"> <p><a href="https://github.com/postlight/awesome-cms">Awesome CMS</a> is&#x2026;an awesome list of awesome CMSes. It&#x2019;s on GitHub, so anyone can add to it via a pull request. Here are some notes on how and why it came to be.</p>\n<h3>Compilation</h3>\n<p>GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/search-syntax/">set of powerful commands</a> for narrowing search results. In seeking out modern content management tools, I used queries like this:</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;q=cms+OR+%22content+management%22+OR+admin+pushed%3A%3E2016-01-01+stars%3A%3E50&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">cms OR &#x201C;content management&#x201D; OR admin pushed:&gt;2016&#x2013;01&#x2013;01 stars:&gt;50</a></p>\n<p>Sorting by stars, I worked my way backwards. I was able to quickly spot relevant CMS projects. I also started to notice some trends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern and popular content management systems are written in PHP, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby. There are also a few content management systems written in&#xA0;.NET (C#), but they are much less popular on GitHub.</li>\n<li>Headless content management systems are gaining popularity. Simply presenting the UI for users to edit content, and relying on the end user to create the user-facing site by ingesting the API. <a href="http://getdirectus.com/">Directus</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudcms.com/">Cloud CMS</a> are headless CMS options.</li>\n<li>Static content management systems don&#x2019;t host pages for you. Instead they help generate your CMS, using static files. <a href="https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms">Netlify CMS</a>, <a href="https://respondcms.com/">Respond CMS</a>, and <a href="https://www.getlektor.com/">Lektor</a> are a few of the options in the static CMS space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Tooling</h3>\n<p>I knew the list of all popular content management systems would be huge. I didn&#x2019;t want to put that data into Markdown directly, as it would be difficult to maintain and to augment with extra data (stars on GitHub, last push date, tags, etc).</p>\n<p>Instead, I opted to store the data in <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>, a human-friendly configuration file language. You can view all of the data that powers Awesome CMS in the <a href="https://github.com/postlight/awesome-cms/tree/97216ef432963d4dfb2238340e2ebf9a4127fb1e/data">data folder</a>. Here&#x2019;s WordPress&#x2019; entry in that file:</p>\n<pre>[[cms]] name = &quot;WordPress&quot; description = &quot;WordPress is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.&quot; url = &quot;https://wordpress.org&quot; github_repo = &quot;WordPress/WordPress&quot; awesome_repo = &quot;miziomon/awesome-wordpress&quot; language = &quot;php&quot;</pre>\n<p>I process this file using JavaScript in <a href="https://github.com/postlight/awesome-cms/blob/97216ef432963d4dfb2238340e2ebf9a4127fb1e/scripts/generateReadme.js">generateReadme.js</a>. It handles processing the TOML, fetching information from GitHub, and generating the final README.md file using the <a href="https://github.com/postlight/awesome-cms/blob/master/README.md.hbs">Handlebars template</a>. I&#x2019;m scraping GitHub for star counts because GitHub&#x2019;s API only allows for 60 requests an hour for authenticated users. We want to make it as easy as possible for anyone to contribute. Requiring users to generate a GitHub authentication token to generate the README wasn&#x2019;t an option.</p>\n<p>By storing the data in TOML at generating the README.md using JavaScript, I&#x2019;ve essentially created an incredibly light-weight, GitHub backed, static CMS to power Awesome CMS.</p>\n<figure class="wp-caption">\n<div id="attachment_2200" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-2200 size-full" src="https://13c27d41k2ud2vkddp226w55-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/03-building-awesome-cms-1.gif" alt="" width="360"><p class="wp-caption-text">I heard you like content management systems</p></div>\n<p><em>Jeremy Mack is a director of engineering at Postlight.&#xA0;</em></p></figure> </div>
