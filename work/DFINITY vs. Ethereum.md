## With an introduction to Nervos
## 介绍Nervos

There's no doubt that Ethereum is the leading public blockchain, that is, a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. However NEO, DFINITY, Cardano and EOS are trying to out-do it now.
毫无疑问，以太坊是领先的公共区块链，即一个运行智能合约的去中心化式平台。然而，NEO，DFINITY，Cardano和EOS现在正试图超越它。

While certainly public blockchain represent a new kind of shared global infrastructure that is interesting to watch, it seems as if how they scale and the 3rd generation dApp platforms are better iterations of the older and more established ones.
虽然公共区块链代表了一种值得关注的新型共享全局基础架构，但似乎它们如何扩展，第三代dApp平台是旧版和更成熟版的更好迭代。

Ethereum itself was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 2014 by fans all around the world. If in 2014 EOS stole "decentralization" from Ethereum as its buzz-word to replicate its mad success, four years later DFINITY is thoroughly milking the 'world computer' analogy to make its point. To the lay person this is somewhat perplexing.
Ethereum本身于2014年8月由世界各地的粉丝通过以太网预售进行自我引导。如果在2014年，EOS从以太坊偷走了“去中心化”作为复制其疯狂成功的热门话题，四年后，DFINITY正在彻底挤压“世界计算机”的类比来说明问题。对于外行人来说，这有点令人困惑。

If Ethereum was developed in response to the lack of capabilities within the Bitcoin protocol, the tangents that Cardano and DFINITY represent need to be watched, along with even newer solutions that will come out of China, such as [Nervos][1].
如果Ethereum是针对比特币协议缺乏能力而开发的，那么Cardano和DFINITY代表的切线需要被观察，甚至更新的解决方案将来自中国，例如[Nervos][1]。

When [Jan Xie][2] wrote about Nervos, I was immediately intrigued. The era of inter operable protocols that allows enterprises to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) is quickly coming. Needless to say, it's difficult to keep track of what is going on now as there are so many MainNets that have gone live and in particular Chinese blockchains are just getting their feet wet now.
当[Jan Xie][2]写下关于Nervos的文章时，我立即被吸引了。允许企业构建和部署去中心化式应用程序（dApps）的可互操作协议的时代正在迅速发展。毋庸置疑，现在很难跟踪现在发生的事情，因为有很多MainNets已经上线，特别是中国区块链现在正在变得潮湿。

#### The Blockchain Coding Boom has Arrived
#### 区块链编码繁荣已经到来

When elegant coders who grew up on Linux are now reaching into 3rd generation blockchain development such as Nervos, you get a feeling that blockchains will quickly become more scalable and important problems will be solved faster as more developers globally get into the space.
当在Linux上长大的优雅编码员现在进入第三代区块链开发（如Nervos）时，您会感觉到区块链将迅速变得更具可扩展性，并且随着全球更多开发人员进入该领域，重要问题将得到更快解决。

If DFINITY raised funds from respected investors Andreesen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, Nervos might become the "Chinese DFINITY", where it's sometimes said NEO is the "Chinese Ethereum". The reason I say this is that Polychain, Sequoia China, Matrix partners and Multicoin, among other top-tier VCs and cryptofunds, have already taken an interest in the potential of Nervos.
如果DFINITY从受尊敬的投资者Andreesen Horowitz和Polychain Capital筹集资金，Nervos可能会成为“中国的DFINITY”，有时候NEO就是“中国的以太坊”。我之所以这么说是因为Polychain，红杉中国，Matrix合作伙伴和Multicoin以及其他顶级风险投资公司和加密产品，已经对Nervos的潜力产生了兴趣。

#### If You're Not "Nervos" You're Not Paying Attention
#### 如果你不是“Nervos”你没有注意

This isn't a consumer product. Developers and being open-source are what matters here. While Ethereum has a lot of developers working on it, with tons of ICOs, that doesn't mean Ethereum will always be the leader from a technical standpoint.
这不是消费品。开发人员和开源是重要的。虽然以太坊有很多开发人员正在研究它，但有大量的ICO，这并不意味着以太网将从技术角度始终成为领导者。

> Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 Bitcoin protocol introduced the first means for independently operated computers to communicate peer-to-peer over the Internet in a remarkable manner that conjures up an indestructible shared virtual ledger — Dom Williams ([DFINITY][5])
>  Satoshi Nakamoto的2008比特币协议引入了第一种独立运行的计算机通过互联网以点对点方式进行通信的方法，这种方式让人联想到一个坚不可摧的共享虚拟分类账--Dom Williams（[DFINITY][5]）

However to me, while Cardano and EOS may have seemed like the new contenders in 2017, in 2018 I'm a bit more excited about DFINITY and Nervos. They are bringing a new terminology of how things could work that's fresh and innovative.
然而对我来说，虽然Cardano和EOS可能在2017年看起来像是新的竞争者，但在2018年我对DFINITY和Nervos感到有点兴奋。他们带来了一个新的术语，说明事情如何运作，这是新鲜和创新的。

Nervos [Interview][7].
Nervos [访谈][7]。

Nervos has a "Cell model" for decentralized application to make development more flexible, more scalable, and more accessible to real businesses that, if you haven't heard about yet in 2018, you will in 2019.
Nervos拥有去中心化应用程序的“Cell模型”，使开发更灵活，更具可扩展性，并且更容易被真实企业访问，如果您在2018年还没有听说过，那么您将在2019年。

According to [CryptoBriefing][8], the foundational layer provided by Nervos is completely decoupled from the dApp on which it runs. Five basic components comprise the system:
根据[CryptoBriefing][8]，Nervos提供的基础层与运行它的dApp完全分离。系统包括五个基本组件：

1. Cells
细胞
2. Cell Types
2. 细胞类型
3. Validators
3. 验证者
4. Generators
4. 发电机
5. Identity
5. 身份

Both DFINITY and Nervos give some concept of the blockchain being like a nervous system. Jan( Xie Hanjian) speaks about blockchain not just being about a trusted "engraving on the stone" metaphor, but as smart contracts that can punish bad actors. That is a new kind of automated security.
DFINITY和Nervos都提供了区块链就像神经系统一样的概念。 Jan（谢汉建）谈到区块链不只是关于一个值得信赖的“雕刻在石头上”的比喻，而是作为可以惩罚坏人的巧妙契约。这是一种新的自动化安全性。

> With auditing and punishment built into a blockchain, this creates a complete system and allows people to build "trust" amongst each other.
> 通过区块链内置的审计和惩罚，这将创建一个完整的系统，并允许人们在彼此之间建立“信任”。

This has important implications for how public blockchains and their communities are also experiments in new forms of digital governance. DFINITY, it turns out, has thought quite deeply about this as well. Where Binance has won easy adoption by being first a centralized crypto exchange, newer blockchains like Nervos also facilitate initial adoption by enterprises by being less hard core than Ethereum. You have to have one foot in the real world to facilitate how businesses can integrate what they do with blockchain.
这对于公共区块链及其社区如何在新形式的数字治理中进行实验具有重要意义。事实证明，DFINITY也对此深有体会。 Binance通过首次集中式加密交换获得了轻松采用的地位，像Nervos这样的新区块链也促进了企业最初的采用，因为它的核心不如以太坊。您必须在现实世界中站稳脚跟，以便于企业将区块链的功能整合到一起。

The Nervos Mainnet is set for May 2019. Nervos is a next-gen enterprise blockchain that's [raised nearly nearly half][9] ($28 million) of what DFINITY has. In an era of rapid appearance of crypto funds, Nervos already has a fair number of substantial allies and backers:
Nervos Mainnet定于2019年5月.Nervos是下一代企业区块链，其筹集的近一半[9]（2800万美元）是DFINITY所拥有的。在加密资金迅速出现的时代，Nervos已经拥有了相当数量的实质性盟友和支持者：

The Nervos founders don't just have former experience in Ethereum, they have familiarity collaborating with [academic institutions][12], banks and so forth. Nervos has an elegant layered network architecture:
Nervos的创始人不仅拥有以太坊的经验，他们熟悉与[学术机构][12]，银行等合作。 Nervos拥有优雅的分层网络架构：

![][13]

The LNA thus feels essentially fluid to meet enterprise needs. The layered architecture of Nervos separates data and computation, giving each layer more flexibility, scalability and the option to use different consensus methods. On the Nervos network, dApps can choose appropriate generators and consensus mechanisms based on specific needs.
因此，LNA在满足企业需求方面感觉非常流畅。 Nervos的分层架构将数据和计算分开，为每一层提供了更大的灵活性，可扩展性以及使用不同共识方法的选项。在Nervos网络上，dApp可以根据具体需求选择合适的生成器和共识机制。

#### The Advent of Hybrid Blockchains
#### 混合区块链的出现

By providing a hybrid solution that combines the advantages of a public blockchain and an application chain, Nervos Network will allow enterprises to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) without committing their entire tech stack to the blockchain. This is key so as to meet the needs of enterprise clients while allowing them still to benefit selectively from blockchain.
通过提供结合了公共区块链和应用程序链优势的混合解决方案，Nervos Network将允许企业构建和部署去中心化式应用程序（dApp），而无需将整个技术堆栈提交到区块链。这是关键，以满足企业客户的需求，同时让他们仍然有选择地从区块链中受益。

The dual-layered design of [Nervos thus][14] to me is one of the more important blockchains to evolve in 2019, thanks to its layers:
由于其层次，[Nervos因此][14]的双层设计是我在2019年发展的更重要的区块链之一：

* Secure public chain (Layer 1)
*安全的公共链（第1层）
* High-performance application chain (Layer 2)
*高性能应用链（第2层）

What I like about DFINITY is it's also very aware that it's being compared to Ethereum and is even compatible with it. I've edited a video they recently put out about how they are different from Etheruem and it's one of the best videos out there for quickly getting a handle on some of the terminology they use.
我喜欢DFINITY的是它也非常清楚它与以太坊相比并且甚至与它兼容。我编辑了他们最近发布的关于它们与Etheruem有何不同的视频，它是最好的视频之一，可以快速掌握他们使用的一些术语。

They go into more detail [here][16]. Cedric's video is really like a crash course on how some of these 3rd-generation blockchains are trying hard to improve on the likes of Ethereum.
他们详细介绍[这里][16]。塞德里克的视频真的就像一个关于这些第三代区块链如何努力改进以太坊等方面的速成课程。

Everyone wants to be the host of the world's next generation of software systems and services. The reality is few smart contract platforms or altcoins will survive in the long-run so, before 2021, we're still in the nascent phase of how this takes place as more developers continue to enter the space.
每个人都希望成为世界下一代软件系统和服务的主机。实际上很少有智能合约平台或山寨币在长期生存下来，所以在2021年之前，随着越来越多的开发商继续进入这个领域，我们仍处于初期阶段。

The folks at DFINITY obviously have been in contact with Ethereum, since Dfinity will be compatible with EVM languages (such as Solidity) too, so you will be able to deploy any Ethereum contract on Dfinity, which is a definite advantage.
DFINITY的人显然已经与以太坊联系，因为Dfinity也将与EVM语言兼容（例如Solidity），因此您将能够在Dfinity上部署任何以太坊合约，这是一个明确的优势。

DFINITY has its own "onion" of layers that may be superior to Ethereum. The key differentiator here is how DFINITY and Nervos speak to enterprise clients more directly. One analogy that has been used is one internet/public blockchain, many LANs/private blockchains. Curiously, DFINITY has been quoted as saying it sees DFINITY's competition as that of the traditional IT stack, not (actually) other blockchains!
DFINITY拥有自己的“洋葱”层，可能优于以太坊。这里的关键区别在于DFINITY和Nervos如何更直接地与企业客户交流。已经使用的一个类比是一个互联网/公共区块链，许多局域网/私有区块链。奇怪的是，DFINITY被引用说它认为DFINITY的竞争是传统IT堆栈的竞争，而不是（实际上）其他区块链！

Someone on Reddit said, "Dfinity is a Prius, Ethereum is a Lamborghini". However DFINITY speaks of itself by using the "world computer" analogy (_internet computer). _It's obviously seeking essentially to do everything Ethereum can do and better, so it's definitely an Ethereum competitor in that sense.
Reddit上有人说，“Dfinity是普锐斯，以太坊是兰博基尼”。然而，DFINITY通过使用“世界计算机”类比（_internet计算机）来说明自己。_显然，它主要是寻求做以太空能做到的事情，并且做得更好，因此在这个意义上它绝对是以太坊的竞争对手。

Dfinity is also mutable to business needs, so Dfinity's consensus rules by design which allows for state changes. Ed Posnak writes about DFINITY [here][17]. He postulates that DFINITY is pursuing a coevolutionary strategy. At the beginning this approach is smart since it builds alignment with what is popular today. In fact, DFINITY is packaged in a much more relatable way, even with the neuron-inspired governance model. It's Silicon Valley co-opting blockchain down to the 2nd office in Crypto Valley.
Dfinity也可以根据业务需求进行调整，因此Dfinity的共识通过设计来规定允许状态变化。 Ed Posnak写道DFINITY [这里][17]。他假设DFINITY正在推行一种共同进化策略。一开始，这种方法很聪明，因为它与当今流行的方式建立了一致性。实际上，即使使用神经元启发的治理模型，DFINITY也以更加相关的方式打包。这是硅谷选择区块链到密码谷的第二个办公室。

Ethereum's immutability and tendency to hard forks means DFINITY's liquid democracy could be superior as both mature. DFINITY's approach employs an architecture that separates consensus, validation, and storage into separate layers, which makes sense for efficiency. DFINITY might turn out to be among the 3rd-generation network contenders that would natively be more scalable than Ethereum. If all goes well, Nervos, Cardano, Qtum and possibly EOS and NEO, among others, might join them.
以太坊的不变性和硬分叉的倾向意味着DFINITY的流动民主可能会更加成熟。 DFINITY的方法采用了一种架构，将共识，验证和存储分离为单独的层，这对提高效率很有意义。 DFINITY可能会成为第三代网络竞争者之一，它本身比以太网更具可扩展性。如果一切顺利，Nervos，Cardano，Qtum以及可能的EOS和NEO等可能会加入他们的行列。

If Ethereum is a "code is law" network, DFINITY is an "AI is law" one. Here is where Nervos and DFINITY might truly shine as third-gen platforms, since they will have better "punishments" for hackers that are philosophically opposed to the system. Where formalized and automated on-chain governance mechanisms (i.e. "punishments") take place, bugs or rogue smart contracts or whatever could be dealt with accordingly.
如果以太坊是一个“代码就是法律”的网络，那么DFINITY就是一个“人工智能是法律”的网络。在这里，Nervos和DFINITY可能真正成为第三代平台，因为他们将对那些在哲学上反对该系统的黑客有更好的“惩罚”。在形式化和自动化的链式治理机制（即“惩罚”）发生的地方，错误或流氓智能合约或其他任何可以相应处理。

As we now know, Ethereum will take years to integrate Casper and sharding completely. If the likes of DFINITY and Nervos can evolve rapidly, there will be a race to scalability that pushes new winners on to the next level of dApp and smart contract adoption in the real world.
正如我们现在所知，以太坊将花费数年时间完全整合Casper和分片。如果像DFINITY和Nervos这样的公司能够快速发展，那么将会出现一种可扩展性的竞争，这种竞争将新的赢家推向更高层次的dApp和现实世界中的智能合约采用。
