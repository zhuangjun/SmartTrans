# Crypto-Keynesian Lunacy
# 加密凯恩斯主义的疯狂

My article on [smart contracts][1] has had quite a reaction, much like the blockchain article before it. I've had a lot of praise and criticism on [the article][1], much coming from the Ethereum/altcoin crowd which didn't like what I said.
我关于[智能合约][1]的文章有很多反应，就像之前的区块链文章一样。我对[文章][1]有很多赞美和批评，很多来自以太坊/山寨币的人群，不像我说的那样。

Chief among the critics vying for my attention is one Kyle Samani, who more or less threw the kitchen sink at my arguments in the form of a [19 message-long tweet][2] storm about my article. I don't follow him on Twitter and wouldn't have noticed, were it not for him specifically pinging me on telegram to take a look.
争夺我注意力的评论家中的主要人物是Kyle Samani，他或多或少地以我的论文的形式发表了一篇关于我文章的[19条长篇推文][2]风暴。我不会在Twitter上关注他，也不会注意到，如果不是他专门用电报打电话给我看看。

Now, I don't normally spend my time arguing with people that are seeking to waste my time, but in this case, I'm going to make an exception because he so clearly embodies what I call [Crypto-Keynesian lunacy][3]. In this article, I'm going to make the case that the economic world view of people like Kyle are fundamentally what drives his criticism and not the technical or social reality.
现在，我通常不会花时间和那些想浪费我时间的人争论，但在这种情况下，我会做一个例外，因为他很清楚地体现了我所说的[加密 - 凯恩斯主义的疯狂][3] ]。在本文中，我将说明像凯尔这样的人的经济世界观基本上是推动他的批评而不是技术或社会现实的原因。

### Crypto-Keynesian Fallacy #1: Aggregate Numbers Tell an Accurate Story
## #

The first argument for smart contracts is that there's a lot more "developer activity" on Ethereum's Turing-complete Solidity. This argument is about as useful as focusing on aggregate demand and aggregate supply that Keynesians love so much. Economic activity by itself doesn't tell you anything. People could be trading the same egg back and forth for a dollar a billion times and that would count in the economic activity statistics as a billion dollars of activity. The aggregate numbers simply don't mean very much because they have at best a very weak correlation with the actual value added.
智能合约的第一个论点是，以太坊的图灵 - 完全结合度还有更多的“开发者活动”。这个论点与关注凯恩斯主义者非常喜爱的总需求和总供给一样有用。经济活动本身并不能告诉你任何事情。人们可以以10亿美元的价格来回交易相同的鸡蛋，并将经济活动统计数据计算为10亿美元的活动。总数并不意味着很多，因为它们最多与实际增加值的相关性非常弱。

![][5]

Belief that developer activity actually means a lot is mistaking action for value. It's true that creating value requires activity, but not all activity adds value. In fact, a lot of activity reduces value. Actually figuring out which activity is valuable and which add nothing or even have a negative effect is not easy and requires a lot of research and technical due diligence. This is why Keynesians focus on easily measured numbers, not on actual reality. Looking at easily measured numbers is much easier than doing the hard work of actually evaluating complicated situations. Crypto-Keynesians do the same thing.
开发者活动实际上意味着很多的信念是错误的价值行为。创造价值确实需要活动，但并非所有活动都能增加价值。事实上，很多活动都会降低价值。实际上，确定哪些活动是有价值的，哪些活动没有增加甚至产生负面影响并不容易，需要大量的研究和技术尽职调查。这就是为什么凯恩斯主义者关注的是容易测量的数字，而不是实际的现实。查看容易测量的数字要比实际评估复杂情况的艰苦工作容易得多。 Crypto-Keynesians做同样的事情。

If you look at protocol development [Bitcoin has many more devs][6]. Most of the "developer activity" on Ethereum is in ICO development and not protocol development. ICOs have been a cash cow for ICO issuers for over a year now. But raising money does not mean you're adding value any more than digging and filling a ditch adds value. Most of these projects have zero users or even a product. Many haven't released anything for years, nor do they need to since they have no obligations to the token holders.
如果你看协议开发[比特币有更多的开发者][6]。以太坊上的大多数“开发者活动”都是在ICO开发中而不是协议开发中。 ICO发行人一年多来一直是ICO的摇钱树。但筹集资金并不意味着你增加价值不仅仅是挖掘和填补沟渠增加价值。这些项目中的大多数都没有用户甚至是产品。许多人多年来没有发布任何东西，他们也不需要，因为他们对代币持有者没有义务。

![][9]

In other words, developer activity is a really poor proxy for usefulness or value-add and ultimately, activity does not mean success. Google Glass, for example had a lot of developer activity, but that didn't mean it was actually useful, viable or successful.
换句话说，开发人员活动对于有用性或增值是一个非常糟糕的代理，最终，活动并不意味着成功。例如，Google Glass有很多开发人员活动，但这并不意味着它实际上是有用的，可行的或成功的。

### Crypto-Keynesian Fallacy #2: Centrally Designed Systems Work Better than Organic Bottom-Up Reality-Tested Systems
## #

Keynesians are famous for their faith in central planning, especially as a way to increase demand. Entire industries like health care, education and housing have felt the heavy hand of government intervention and desire to do "what's best for us" despite our protests. Crypto-Keynesians are the same way. Their faith in centrally planning products perfectly from the outset is astonishing and largely driven by hopium.
凯恩斯主义者以其对中央计划的信心而闻名，特别是作为增加需求的一种方式。尽管我们有抗议活动，但医疗保健，教育和住房等整个行业都感受到了政府干预的重手，并渴望做出“对我们最有利的事情”。加密 - 凯恩斯主义是一样的。他们从一开始就完美地集中规划产品的信念令人惊讶，并且主要受到啤酒花的驱动。

What's more, a lot of these centrally designed systems are much less efficient and require a lot more overhead. Provably fair gambling can be done without the large overhead of an expensive blockchain. You can [prove something existed][10] at a certain point in time without the cost of millions of transactions that get replicated thousands of times. The hubris of central planning is that they not only think everything will work, but that it's the best solution from the outset.
更重要的是，许多这些集中设计的系统效率低得多，需要更多的开销。可以证明公平赌博没有昂贵的区块链的大量开销。你可以[在某个时间点证明存在的东西][10]而不需要数百万次交易的成本被复制数千次。中央计划的狂妄性在于，他们不仅认为一切都会奏效，而且从一开始就是最好的解决方案。

But that's assuming something works. Most of the projects in the crypto space have added zero value. In fact, many have swindled, scammed and stolen as to subtract value. The fact that so many projects have failed to deliver value should be humbling. Instead, for a Crypto-Keynesian, this is only evidence that the big use-case are just around the corner and that new and interesting breakthroughs are only a few months away. They believe that raising money/hiring people is evidence that actual value is about to be delivered soonish™.
但这是假设有效的方法。加密空间中的大多数项目都增加了零值。事实上，许多人已经欺骗，诈骗和被盗，以减去价值。这么多项目未能实现价值的事实应该是令人羞愧的。相反，对于加密凯恩斯主义者来说，这只是证据表明大用例即将到来，新的有趣突破只有几个月之后。他们认为，筹集资金/雇用人员是证明实际价值即将交付的证据。

The bottom-up reality is that most people simply don't care to use these systems unless heavily incentivized to do so. Usually, that means that the users are actually investors, which is a nice way of saying that the users are really in a [Multi-Level Marketing][13] scheme searching for new investors that will use the systems in the same way.
自下而上的现实是，大多数人根本不关心使用这些系统，除非有很大的激励。通常，这意味着用户实际上是投资者，这是一种很好的方式，可以说用户真的在[多层次营销][13]方案中寻找将以相同方式使用系统的新投资者。

Systems are really, really hard to design and are very rarely right the first time. As any startup veteran will tell you, it's really hard to find a product-market fit and many not only try different models, but often pivot to entire different industries for that reason. Successful startups try lots of things to see which things work and iterate. The best startups find solutions to existing problems. By contrast, most of these crypto startups are trying to find problems for the crap that they want to build.
系统真的非常非常难以设计，而且很少是第一次使用。正如任何创业老手都会告诉你的那样，很难找到适合产品市场的产品，许多人不仅尝试不同的模型，而且经常因此而转向整个不同的行业。成功的初创公司会尝试很多东西来看看哪些东西可以工作和迭代。最好的创业公司找到现有问题的解决方案。相比之下，这些加密初创公司中的大多数都试图为他们想要构建的垃圾找到问题。

What's really scary about blockchain systems is that you really can't iterate or change things very much without throwing out all pretense of decentralization. Thus, Crypto-Keynesians have to believe any investments they make will be correct and successful _on the first try_. This is simply not the reality of complex systems or markets. At best, the iterations in these projects are very slow, enormously expensive and really hard to change.
区块链系统真正令人害怕的是，如果不抛弃所有去中心化的借口，你真的无法迭代或改变事物。因此，Crypto-Keynesians必须相信他们所做的任何投资都是正确的，并且在第一次尝试时也是成功的。这根本不是复杂系统或市场的现实。充其量，这些项目中的迭代非常缓慢，非常昂贵并且很难改变。

### Crypto-Keynesian Fallacy #3: Everyone Will Do Things Exactly As Expected
## #

The most hilarious part of Kyle's tweet storm was saying how the NBA.com server would be the source of truth and therefore, Oracles could be trusted and smart contracts can be useful for non-digital stuff.
凯尔的推特风暴中最热闹的部分是说NBA.com服务器将如何成为事实的来源，因此，可以信任Oracles，智能合约可以用于非数字化的东西。

Remember, the Oracle is the last word on the smart contract. There is no further adjudication in a decentralized setting. You can't appeal to another judge should something go wrong. You simply have to accept _whatever the Oracle says_.
请记住，Oracle是智能合约的最后一个词。在去中心化的环境中没有进一步的裁决。如果出现问题，你不能诉诸另一位法官。您只需接受_无论Oracle说什么_。

Apparently, this enormous attack surface an Oracle adds is not really even considered. Who controls the data feed from nba.com? Can that get hacked? Would anyone in a gambling situation be incentivized to affect this feed? Say you got 100–1 odds on the Cavaliers when they were down 3–0 to the Warriors and bet $1M on the Cavs. Would you have incentive to hack the servers so you could be paid out in a bearer instrument? Would you be incentivized to bribe the nba.com IT guy? Would you kidnap the person's family? After all, you would only need to change the Oracle's vote. Given that the ambitions of these projects are to take over the entire sports betting market ($3B/yr), this is not just theoretical.
显然，甲骨文增加的这个巨大的攻击面甚至都没有考虑过。谁控制来自nba.com的数据Feed？可以被黑客攻击吗？赌博情况下的任何人都会被激励影响这个饲料吗？假设你在骑士队以3比0战胜勇士队并在骑士队投注100万美元时获得了100-1赔率。您是否有动力破解服务器，以便您可以通过不记名工具获得支付？你会被激励贿赂nba.com IT人吗？你会绑架这个人的家人吗？毕竟，您只需要更改Oracle的投票。鉴于这些项目的目标是接管整个体育博彩市场（每年3美元），这不仅仅是理论上的。

An adversarial network requires a lot of thought about the actual incentives. In addition, the more complicated the system is, the more you have to test out what holes in the incentive structure there might be. Most of these projects are ridiculously complicated. Bitcoin, by comparison, is orders of magnitude simpler and less vulnerable in terms of incentive structure. To think that you've designed an incentive structure that's correct on the first try is absolute lunacy and reflects a lack of real world experience.
对抗性网络需要对实际激励进行大量思考。此外，系统越复杂，您就越需要测试激励结构中可能出现的漏洞。大多数这些项目都非常复杂。相比之下，比特币在激励结构方面更简单，更不容易受到攻击。认为你设计的第一次尝试是正确的激励结构是绝对的疯狂，反映了缺乏真实的世界经验。

The usual response by a Crypto-Keynesian when faced with such questions is to refer you to some added incentives in the system like additional Oracles, bonded Oracles, or some such. It's usually a half-baked idea that anyone can figure out holes to in 5 minutes, but that's the normal response. There's probably a solution to every possible attack vector, but most of the time, each "solution" creates an even bigger attack surface. Eventually the solutions get so complicated and so hard to analyze that the flaws can only be revealed by the cold, hard slap of reality.
Crypto-Keynesian在面对这些问题时通常的反应是在系统中引用一些额外的激励措施，例如额外的Oracles，保护的Oracles或其他类似的东西。这通常是一个半生不熟的想法，任何人都可以在5分钟内找到漏洞，但这是正常的反应。每种可能的攻击向量都可能有解决方案，但大多数情况下，每个“解决方案”都会创建一个更大的攻击面。最终，解决方案变得如此复杂，难以分析，只能通过现实的冷酷实施来揭示缺陷。

### Conclusion
### 结论

The real weakness of Keynesianism is the belief you can get something for nothing. It's the [broken window fallacy][16] in a macro form.
凯恩斯主义的真正弱点是相信你可以无所作为。这是宏观形式的[破窗谬误][16]。

![][18]

Crypto-Keynesianism makes essentially the same error. Developer activity by itself means very little. Centralized systems generally don't work very well on the ground. Incentives are really hard to get right. This is why we have so many ICOs. They are "doing something", but not adding value. You may be raising money, you may be hiring people, you may be donating to some causes but you're not adding value until the market buys your product or service. And no, you don't get to brag about how "successful" you are until you've actually added value and not anytime before then.
加密凯恩斯主义基本上会产生同样的错误。开发人员活动本身意味着很少。集中系统通常在地面上不能很好地工作。激励措施真的很难做到。这就是我们有这么多ICO的原因。他们“做某事”，但没有增加价值。您可能正在筹集资金，您可能正在招聘人员，您可能会捐赠某些原因，但在市场购买您的产品或服务之前，您不会增加价值。不，你不会吹嘘自己是多么“成功”，直到你真正增加价值，而不是在此之前的任何时候。

The real innovation was and always has been Bitcoin. Bitcoin is sound money and sound money is what allows you to preserve value over the long term. That, in turn allows people to save for large capital projects which, in turn, [build up civilization][19]. [Crypto-Austrians][3] believe this is the basis for building in the future, not in these pie-in-the-sky projects that don't deliver value.
真正的创新一直是比特币。比特币是合理的金钱，声音金钱可以让您长期保持价值。这反过来又允许人们为大型资本项目储蓄，而这些项目反过来又会[建立文明][19]。 [Crypto-Austrians][3]相信这是未来建设的基础，而不是这些无法实现价值的天空项目。

Crypto-Keynesians believe success is simply having money. They are two separate things. You can make money by adding to civilization or you can make money by rent-seeking. The former should be applauded. The latter should be despised.
Crypto-Keynesians认为成功只是赚钱。它们是两个不同的东西。你可以通过增加文明赚钱，或者你可以通过寻租来赚钱。前者应该受到称赞。应该鄙视后者。

The ICO boom makes clear that Crypto-Keynesians can't tell the difference. This leads to the building products that add "activity" but fail in delivering any sort of value, in effect digging and filling ditches and pretending that means something. This is Crypto-Keynesian lunacy.
ICO的繁荣表明Crypto-Keynesians无法区分。这导致建筑产品增加了“活动”但却无法提供任何价值，实际上挖掘和填充沟渠并假装意味着什么。这是加密 - 凯恩斯主义的疯狂。
