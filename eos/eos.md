--------

1. <a id="footnote-0"></a>  We all know what the EOS governed blockchain is, but it is difficult to describe EOS in a decisive way\. That’s why we have left this open\. There will be some sort of a grey area that needs to be filled in by jurisprudence but we believe that would also have been there, should we have tried to nail down all the EOS elements relevant for this constitution\. [↑](#footnote-ref-0)

2. <a id="footnote-1"></a> Member is an individual who directly or indirectly uses EOS\. [↑](#footnote-ref-1)

3. <a id="footnote-2"></a> Ownership is an open concept\. It is the most comprehensive set of rights a person \(legal entity or human being\) has regarding a good or right, an asset\. The owner of the house is the person registered in the public registry \(in Europe at least\)\. The owner of a bike is the person that is entitled to sell it and use it \(unless he has rented it out\)\. The owner of a token is the person that is entitled to sell it and is entitled to receive the sales price\. That person could be the key holder to such token, but the key holder could also hold the token for someone else\. Than that someone else is the real owner\. [↑](#footnote-ref-2)

4. <a id="footnote-3"></a> This is to ensure EOS is not taken over by one party\. It might be difficult to establish but we believe that the legal challenges \(including claims for damages\) an owner of more than 10% will encounter, are of such a magnitude that it is not worth taking the risk\. We distinguished between ownership and voting\. [↑](#footnote-ref-3)

5. <a id="footnote-4"></a> So if a Member owns two companies that each own 0,7% of the issued EOS tokens, both companies together can only cast 1% of the issued EOS tokens\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-4)

6. <a id="footnote-5"></a> These elements are often used to determine whether or not someone has a cartel in the off chain world\. I am not fond of more or less subjective norms but they are needed to stop unwanted behaviour that falls outside of the clearly forbidden actions\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-5)

7. <a id="footnote-6"></a> This would mean that the instructions need to be given in the language of the agreement\. Otherwise the proxy cannot proof that the owner did get the instructions\. [↑](#footnote-ref-6)

8. <a id="footnote-7"></a> Proxy voting is acceptable\. Also if such proxy were to cast more than 5% of the votes\. But voters shouldn’t be locked in\. In other words: a combination of an exchange service and proxy voting will mean that the owner cannot freely choose his or hers proxy since that would mean they would have to leave the exchange which is burdensome\. So in that event the exchange shall have to allow for voting instructions by such owner\. This is loosely based on general notices in the law about the way power of attorneys work \(which a proxy is\)\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-7)

9. <a id="footnote-8"></a> Common control would diminish competition between the block producers\. Also it could make the chain vulnerable to outside pressures since the chain is being operated by fewer parties\. That’s why we have introduced a ban on common control\. To know if there is common control, we suggested simple measures\. A block producer has to publish its group structure\. \(A group meaning entities that are under common control and/or work as an economic entity\)\. As well as their ultimate beneficiaries\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-8)

10. <a id="footnote-9"></a> This doesn’t mean a BP is obliged to follow arbitrator’s award\. That is up to their own discretion\. However, if a verdict clearly shows that e\.g\. theft has taken place, a BP will act accordingly\. It is further possible that a BP is a party to certain proceedings\. Then also this clause ensures that they do not become liable if they act in accordance with the outcome of such proceedings\. They only must follow an arbitrator’s award under this charter if it has been provided by a selected arbitrator\. That is in the following paragraph \(7\.4\)\. [↑](#footnote-ref-9)

11. <a id="footnote-10"></a> This clause is only applicable if and in as far there is no arbitrator’s order yet\. Please note further that in the event the block producer makes a mistake here, the block producer may become liable\. But if in the event of a clear infringement of which the block producer is aware, the block producer refrains from action such block producer may become liable also\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-10)

12. <a id="footnote-11"></a> This is meant generally and, for the avoidance of doubt, is also applicable to the decision whether or not to execute the code taken in 7\.3\.2\. So unless the BP takes that decision intently wrong \(or grossly negligently wrong\), the BP is not liable\. [↑](#footnote-ref-11)

13. <a id="footnote-12"></a>Developer \- a person or company that creates innovate products, such as software\.This is to encourage the writing of code and \(smart\) contracts\. Who shall be considered to be a developer shall have to be broadly interpreted \(and include also the writers of this constitution\)\. [↑](#footnote-ref-12)

14. <a id="footnote-13"></a>The arbitration system is a set of rules \(on the EOS network\) that the members of the EOS community obey in case of disputes\. The arbitration system allows you to participate in resolving a dispute of any number of arbitration providers\. Arbitration providers can compete with each other and demonstrate differences from other providers\. So the principle is that the parties themselves choose their dispute resolution\. They are free to do so\. Even if it concerns EOS\. Even if it regards disputes about this charter or the execution of the EOS core code\. That must be done in their agreements and, in the event they have not done so, they can do so once the dispute has occurred\. If they do not do so, the default dispute resolution comes into play\. In the event of theft, there is no agreement between the parties \(parties here being the thief and his victim\) and therefore the default forum shall apply\. Please note that the BPs are not obliged to follow awards from arbitrators other than those of the selected arbitration provider\. We believe it is necessary to have one or more default arbitration providers\. If not, this could lead to an unnecessary level of insecurity about the forum in the event the parties do not choose a forum or in the event such choice is invalid\. [↑](#footnote-ref-13)

15. <a id="footnote-14"></a>Arbitration rules are described in detail in the RDR Rules of Dispute Resolution\. ECAF is there now\. When this charter is in force, the block producers meeting shall have to formally appoint ECAF should they want them to be \(one of the\) arbitration providers\. I have introduced language that allows for ECAF to continue until the block producers meeting has provided another selected arbitration provider\.   
It will be possible to have various providers for various problems\. E\.g\. WIPO \(World Intellectual Property Organization\) arbitration could be used for pure intellectual property disputes\. Further, the arbitration system shall have to mention the costs\. Those may vary in accordance with the complexity of the case\. It should be very clear that dispute resolution is costly, though\. this shouldn’t be a major issue if the amounts are considerable\. With smaller amounts, costs will start to hurt\. That’s why many dispute resolution providers offer simple, straightforward business\-consumer solutions against far lower costs\. The BPs meeting can introduce such low\-cost arbitration for low\-level disputes\. [↑](#footnote-ref-14)

16. <a id="footnote-15"></a> An arbitrator can rule in accordance with the law or in fairness\. This is EOS\. We don’t want legal small print that complicates so many court cases\. That’s why we choose for fairness\. [↑](#footnote-ref-15)

17. <a id="footnote-16"></a> One may have cheap and simple proceedings for simple cases \(e\.g\. theft\) and extensive \(and therefore expensive\) proceedings for complicated cases \(e\.g\. the question whether or not block producers voted in an orchestrated way\)\.   [↑](#footnote-ref-16)

18. <a id="footnote-17"></a> Appeal is essential in an emerging legal system\. It is needed to align the various verdicts and work towards clear and predictable rules\.   [↑](#footnote-ref-17)

19. <a id="footnote-18"></a> We believe mediation often provides quick and cheap dispute resolution; [↑](#footnote-ref-18)

20. <a id="footnote-19"></a> As for the Sudo discussion: \(if we are correctly informed\), Sudo provides a way of exercising BPs powers that BPs already have but do it in a more streamlined manner\. Such a system wouldn’t be against this Constitution\. [↑](#footnote-ref-19)

21. <a id="footnote-20"></a> There is no applicable law stipulated here\. That means that this charter should be interpreted literally in as far is possible under the applicable law found by applying applicable conflict of law\. In the event of mandatory provisions that run contrary to this charter, the parties should try and circumvent those\.That will not be easy\.  This means that it is hard to predict if this charter shall function in all jurisdictions as it is meant to\. This lead to uncertainty\. To avoid such uncertainty, generally speaking, it is better to choose an applicable law system aforehand\. We understand however that the community believes, understandably also,  that a choice of law would lead to too much centralization and to unfair advantages for some\.  [↑](#footnote-ref-20)
